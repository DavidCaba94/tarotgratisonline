                  <h2 class="subtitulo">Today's Tarot deck is based on the 78-card standard that was popular in northern Italy in the 16th century.
                    The Major Arcana cards usually represent important themes in the life of the consultant. They are the key fundamental principles
                    of human life, such as life and death, ethical dilemmas, spirituality and interaction with other people. One can see the Arcana
                    Elders as a spiritual picture that you can use as a consultant to chart your course as you make your way through life and beyond.
                    The Minor Arcana often deal with the mundane and superficial and how the seeker reacts to them. However, in making a reading
                    the differences between Major and Minor arcana are often blurred as the cards interact with each other and show a perfect picture
                    the life of the consultant and his or her influences.
                      <br><br>
                      The 22 Major Arcana cards are usually considered the most important cards in the deck as they reveal the
                      foundations and pillars of the consultant's life. They consist of universally recognized archetypes and highly symbolic figures
                      that cross a wide spectrum of mythology and religion.</h2>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">The Fool is a very powerful card in the Tarot deck that usually represents a new beginning - and as a consequence
                        the end of something in your previous life. The position of the Madman in your print run reveals which aspects of your life may be subject to change. The Madman announces
                        that important decisions are coming up that may be difficult to make, and that may mean a risk for you. Approach change with optimism
                        and care to obtain the most positive result possible.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">The Wizard generally associates himself with intelligent and skilled communicators. Their presence in your print run indicates that you possess
                        a level of self-confidence and determination that allows you to translate ideas into action. This is a very practical letter whose revelations are
                        better applied to the pragmatic and physical aspects of your life, but not to the theoretical or ephemeral ones. Your success in future endeavours in the
                        politics or business will depend on your own willpower and determination.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">Your association with the Priestess suggests that you possess good judgment in the form of a strong intuition. She may be indicating
                        that reason must take second place to instinct. Your head must trust in the wisdom of your heart. However, it also symbolizes
                        the help of nature and its presence in certain parts of your print run may indicate that someone close to you will come to your rescue with their intuition.
                        Intuition is also more effective in seeing what is hidden from the senses. Therefore, the Priestess can also symbolise a warning
                        of hidden facts that are or will be important to you.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">Traditionally associated with a strong maternal influence, the presence of the Empress brings you excellent
                        news if you are looking for harmony in your marriage or hoping to start a family. Any artistic activity you are currently involved in
                        will be more successful as this charter often meets those who are exposed to strong bursts of creative or artistic energy. However,
                        that creative energy may not be in the form of a painting or an artistic project. This letter also suggests a strong possibility of pregnancy --
                        not necessarily yours, but you may see a new addition to your family or the family of a close friend in the near future. This is a good letter
                        omen for you and those around you.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">The Emperor is the counterpart of the Empress and symbolises a powerful influence, usually of a male nature.
                        This can also include concepts in your life that have been considered historically masculine, such as leadership and authority, self-discipline and
                        stability through the power of action Their positive influences suggest that you can be on the path to promotion or advancement, but also
                        can be neutral. Usually the partner of those destined to take greater responsibility, it can presage changes or losses that require
                        that you take a step forward to take on a greater burden than you have in the past. Whatever the impetus for change, it indicates that you may have a
                        an out of the ordinary inner strength that will force you to act and lead.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">Depending on your own nature, the High Priest can mean very different things. He basically represents the doctrine,
                        But doctrine can come in the form of teaching and guidance or rigid authority. Where it appears in your print run is also important since
                        often indicates your own perspective on the moral, religious and social conventions of the world. If considered wisely, it helps to show us the
                        the way to realization.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">Your first instinct will be to associate this letter as a representative of love, but like love it does not possess a nature
                        simple. Love not only comes in many forms but Lovers can indicate that difficult or important decisions are coming up in your life. This
                        is bad in the sense that these decisions are usually mutually exclusive, they are paths to two totally different futures. But they are also
                        is good because it confirms that at least one of those paths will lead you to the right place. Therefore, if you find this letter in your print run you should
                        take it into account with caution but without fear. She says that difficult, even painful decisions are coming, but that the right decision will bring
                        a positive result is within your reach.</p>

                        compromising is likely to be long and difficult. You are likely to experience hard, long, uphill roads, dead ends and
                        exit and painful setbacks. A good result can only be assured if the card is standing. But do not lose hope. This hard road will
                        will inspire a strong sense of purpose, the ability to succeed through organization and resilience, and the confidence that only those
                        who have done something they didn't think possible. Used correctly, few forces can stand up to such a person.</p>

                        against an illness or recovering from an injury. As you might suspect, its influence on you and the use you make of it can be directed towards the light
                        or darkness. You will probably tend to face your problems with courage and conquer them through perseverance and will. With this
                        ability to overcome life's obstacles comes also the responsibility to control yourself. This letter can be a warning to take
                        the reins of your own actions and emotions before they hurt you or the people you care about.</p>

                        Finding the Hermit in your turada suggests that this moment has arrived for you. You need a period of inner reflection, away from the current
                        demands of your position. This withdrawal can be physical or an inner search. Only an honest and deep introspection will lead you to a solution.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">The Wheel of Fortune symbolises the cycles of life and speaks of new beginnings. You will most likely find that these
                        events are positive, but being governed by luck, they may be beyond your control and influence. Pay attention to those things you can
                        control carefully, and learn not to suffer with those you cannot control.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">It is very good to find the card of Justice in your print run if you have acted with kindness and fairness towards others,
                        especially if you've been a victim. It is an important indicator of a positive resolution, although how and what kind will depend on your own
                        experiences. However, if you have been unfair, abusive and immoral in your dealings then pay attention. At best, this letter
                        represents for the unjust a warning to change their ways before they are punished, and in the worst case it is a
                        message that it is already too late. In neutral cases it may simply be telling you to seek balance in your life.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">The Hanging can be interpreted in two different ways. Every change is in turn a small death, since the old must
                        die to create the new. It may simply indicate a change in your future that may be beyond your control, and that will be a decision of the
                        which, for better or worse, you cannot take back. The other interpretation speaks of sacrifice. Although it is not easy to know if this sacrifice is
                        big or small. Both interpretations remain implicit and you should think long and hard before making a decision in your life.</p>

                      <p class="descripcion-carta">Death indicates changes in your future. This change can occur in almost any aspect of your life, but it will surely be
                        permanent, significant and absolute. Death suggests a complete separation between the past and the future and will most likely be painful. In spite of
                        of the sense of loss that may accompany it, Death plays a natural and important role in life, and eventually leads to acceptance.
                        It is a necessary part of moving forward and you will find that changes are easier if you accept them rather than fight against them. Wait for the end of
                        a close friendship, a job, a marriage or even life, but don't focus too much on the negative.</p>

                        calm. She recognizes that the opposing forces need not be at war within you. Step carefully into all the important decisions you make.

                        to this one. The warning may or may not allow you to avoid the trap. The type of trap and how you should avoid it will depend on the place the Devil takes in your print run

                        or intuition, but it is a change that comes from reason. It means that plans, which have often taken time to be carried out, are
                        If it points to the future, it can also talk about the nature of change. If a decision needs to be made, you should let your
                        mind take it. In this case, logic is a better guide than intuition. You must be prepared to make a big decision in your life, probably a
                        that will shape the next chapter of your life.</p>

                        and a deeper understanding. It suggests that you may be approaching a more mature understanding of your identity and the self-confidence that comes
                        with age. It also represents the fall of barriers, sometimes in the spiritual sense, but sometimes in the purely physical sense, indicating a future
                        with travel.</p>
